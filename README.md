# Adaptive-Noise-Cancellation
In this project, we build a system that "intelligently" listens to noise, learns its pattern, and removes it.
• Adaptive Filtering: Implements an LMS filter to remove unknown noise.
• System Identification: Uses reference noise to identify the system. 
• Convergence Time: Analyzes the effect of Step Size on the convergence speed of the filter
