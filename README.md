# Adaptive-Noise-Cancellation
In this project, we build a system that "intelligently" listens to noise, learns its pattern, and removes it. • Adaptive Filtering: Implements an LMS filter to remove unknown noise. • System Identification: Uses reference noise to identify the system. • Convergence Time: Analyzes the effect of Step Size on the convergence speed of the filter
